* WHY "DATA VISUALIZATION"?

  #+attr_html: :width 700px
  #+caption: Charles Minard, Napoleon's Russian campaign 1812
  [[../img/1_minard.png]]

  - The purpose of data science is /pattern identification/
  - /Visualization/ happens in the head of the researcher first
  - /Graphing/ happens throughout, /storytelling/ happens last

  #+begin_notes
  - The diagram by Charles Minard (1869) tells the story of Napoleon's
    disastrous Russian campaign in 1812 (datavizblog.com, 2013)
  - Variables: army location, temperature, size over time
  - Diagram type: [[https://analytics.googleblog.com/2011/12/sankey-diagrams-and-flow-over-hundred.html][Sankey flow diagram]] ([[https://www.sankey-diagrams.com/][many examples]])
  - Data type: time series (an object class, ~ts~, in R)
  - The story of this campaign is also the backstory for Tolstoy's
    novel [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace]["WAR AND PEACE" (Война и мир, 1867)]]

* TESTS (NOT GRADED)
  #+attr_html: :width 500px
  #+caption: Start page of the entry quiz on Canvas
  [[../img/1_entry_quiz.png]]

  - Tests have to be completed online, are timed, and have a deadline;
    after the deadline, you can play them an unlimited number of times
  - There will be a revision quiz on Canvas every week, consisting of
    5-10 multiple choice, matching and true/false questions.
  - A subset of the test questions will form the final exam (20% of your
    final grade) - we will practice in the last week before the exam.

* PRACTICE - COURSE INFRASTRUCTURE

  *Useful:* take notes! Practice leads to mastery and the practice
  exercises will often come back to haunt you in the tests.

  1) Open a browser
  2) Find the GitHub repos (birkenkrahe/ds1 and /org)
  3) Open the command line terminal
  4) Open/close R
  5) Open Emacs
  6) Find the Emacs tutorial
  7) Open/close R inside Emacs
  8) Run R in an Org-mode file
  9) Close Emacs
