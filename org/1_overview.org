#+begin_notes
"An illustration of several plots of the same data with curves fitted
to the points, paired with conclusions that you might draw about the
person who made them. These data, when plotted on an X/Y graph, appear
to have a general upward trend, but the data is far too noisy, with
too few data points, to clearly suggest any specific growth
pattern. In such a case, many different mathematical and statistical
models could be presented as roughly fitting the data, but none of
them fits well enough to compellingly represent the data." Source:

- The purpose of data science is /pattern identification/
- /Visualization/ happens in the head of the researcher first
- /Graphing/ happens throughout, /storytelling/ happens last

  #+begin_notes
  - The diagram by Charles Minard (1869) tells the story of Napoleon's
    disastrous Russian campaign in 1812 (datavizblog.com, 2013)
  - Variables: army location, temperature, size over time
  - Diagram type: [[https://analytics.googleblog.com/2011/12/sankey-diagrams-and-flow-over-hundred.html][Sankey flow diagram]] ([[https://www.sankey-diagrams.com/][many examples]])
  - Data type: time series (an object class, ~ts~, in R)
  - The story of this campaign is also the backstory for Tolstoy's
    novel [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace]["WAR AND PEACE" (Война и мир, 1867)]]

- What is a team project? 
- Do you have examples for data science projects?
- Can you do a project as an absolute beginner?

  *Note:* the first /[[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#what-is-a-sprint-review][sprint review]]/ is on August 31. Use it to present your

#+attr_html: :width 500px
#+caption: Start page of the entry quiz on Canvas
[[../img/1_entry_quiz.png]]

- Tests have to be completed online, are timed, and have a deadline;
  after the deadline, you can play them an unlimited number of times
- There will be a revision quiz on Canvas every week, consisting of
  5-10 multiple choice, matching and true/false questions.
- A subset of the test questions will form the final exam (20% of your
  final grade) - we will practice in the last week before the exam.

* Practice - course infrastructure

*Useful:* take notes! Practice leads to mastery and the practice
exercises will often come back to haunt you in the tests.

1) Open a browser
2) Find the GitHub repos (birkenkrahe/dviz and /org)
3) Open the command line terminal
4) Open/close R
5) Open Emacs
6) Find the Emacs tutorial
7) Open/close R inside Emacs
8) Run R in an Org-mode file
9) Close Emacs
10) Close the command line terminal

*Note:* Class room practice completion = 10 points each for active
participation.

[fn:1]CMS = Content Management System; these are the most common
systems in business applications - present whenever people create
'content' of any sort (documents e.g.) and need to store it for
later. CMS systems rely on database technology. In the case of
Canvas, that's MySQL.
