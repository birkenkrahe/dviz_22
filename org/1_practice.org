  4) Open the app

* TODO Open/close R from the terminal

  1) In the terminal, after the prompt ~>~, enter the command ~R~
  2) On the R shell, enter the command ~plot(rnorm(1000))~
  3) A graph will appear in a separate window
  4) On the R shell, enter the command ~head(mtcars)~
  5) The first six lines of a data frame appear in the shell
  6) Enter ~q()~ and confirm with ~n~ to leave the R shell

     #+begin_example
     STUDENT: YourName [PLEDGED]
     Time-stamp: <>
     #+end_example

  3) While visiting the buffer, insert a time stamp with the command
     ~M-x time-stamp~. Save the file with ~C-x C-w~ as a ~.txt~ file and

  3) Open a Emacs GUI with the command: ~emacs~
  4) The start screen now shows an image at the top
  5) Create a new Org-mode file ~Rtest.org~ with ~C-x C-f~
  6) In the file, enter the following two code blocks as shown:
     #+attr_html: :width 400px    
     [[../img/practice_R.png]]
  7) Move your cursor over the first block and enter ~C-c C-c~ to execute
     it. Then move your cursor over the second block and execute
     it. Two ~#+Results~ appear:
