* WHY DO WE ANALYZE DATA?

- Well, what do you think?

#+begin_notes
Tip: reframe WHY questions as WHAT questions -

- What data?
- What analysis?
- What benefits?

1. to *understand* what has happened or what is happening;
2. to *predict* what is likely to happen, either in the future or in
   other circumstances we haven't seen;
3. to *guide* us in making decisions.

* DATA - CONCEPT

- An *entity*, e.g.
  + family history of patient in medical study
  + competing company characteristics in marketing analysis

- An *event*, e.g.
  + demographic characteristics of voters
  + locations visited during a shopping visit

- A *process*, e.g.
  + manufacturing data from a production line
  + hiring data from an application process

* DATA - PRACTICE

- Data structures = rectangular array of observed values
- Rows = observation of entity, event, or process
- Columns = recorded characteristic or attribute

#+begin_notes
- Data frame rows and columns have /names/
- Complete description with [[http://127.0.0.1:23426/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html][help(mtcars)]]
- Meta data supplement data frame content
#+end_notes

* META DATA

- "Data about data" (Greek μετά = 'after', 'beyond')
- Meta data in ~mtcars~:
  + Original source of the data
  + Scientific paper analyzing the data
  + Description of the variables (columns)

*What could be issues with metadata?*

#+begin_notes
- *Completeness* - origin
- *Consistency* - logic, values, (time) dependency
- *Accuracy* - origin and validity
#+end_notes

#+begin_quote
"As potentially valuable as metadata is, we cannot afford to accept it
uncritically: we should always cross-check the metadata with the
actual data values, with our intuition and prior understanding of the
subject matter, and with other sources of information that may be
available." (Pearson, 2018)
