- *Data* is a nebulous concept
- *Coding* seems (still) hard
- *Statistics* is a vast field
- *Story* does not seem solid

* WHY DO WE ANALYZE DATA?

- Well, what do you think?

#+begin_notes
Tip: reframe WHY questions as WHAT questions -

- What data?
- What analysis?
- What benefits?

Pearson:
#+begin_quote
1. to *understand* what has happened or what is happening;
2. to *predict* what is likely to happen, either in the future or in
   other circumstances we haven't seen;
3. to *guide* us in making decisions.

* DATA - CONCEPT

- An *entity*, e.g.
  + family history of patient in medical study
  + competing company characteristics in marketing analysis

- An *event*, e.g.
  + demographic characteristics of voters
  + locations visited during a shopping visit

- A *process*, e.g.
  + manufacturing data from a production line
  + hiring data from an application process

* DATA - PRACTICE

- Data structures = rectangular array of observed values
- Rows = observation of entity, event, or process
- Columns = recorded characteristic or attribute

* DATA FRAMES
