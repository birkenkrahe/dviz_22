* README

  - Practice instructions for the data visualization lectures
  - Emacs + ESS + Org-mode and R must be installed
  - Upload the completed file as a class assignment ([[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/571/assignments/1704][Canvas link]])

* TODO Identify yourself

  - Update the ~#+AUTHOR:~ information in the header
  - Add this on a line to the header of this file :
  - Put your cursor on the headline of this section, and type ~S <LEFT>~
    until you see ~DONE~ instead of ~TODO~ next to the title.
  - Perform this last step each time you complete a section.
* TODO Compare two data frames

  In the [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dviz/blob/piHome/org/2_data_eda_R.org][last lecture]], you saw [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dviz/blob/piHome/img/2_brain.png][some plots]] from the ~mammals~ data frame
  of the ~MASS~ package, giving body weights and brain weights for 62
  animals.

  The ~Animals2~ data frame from the ~robustbase~ package gives the same
  characterizations for a different set of animals.

  In both cases, the row names for these data frames identify these
  animals, and the objective of this exercise is to examine the
  differences between the animals characterized in these data frames.

* TODO Make the required packages available.

  /Tip: packages need to be installed (once) and loaded (per session)./

  Use this code block to start a session and run the necessary commands:

  #+begin_src R :session :results silent
       ...
  #+end_src

  Remember when asked to start the session in the same directory
  where your practice file resides.

* TODO Identify common data

  The ~rownames~ function returns a vector or row names for a data
  frame, and the ~intersect~ function computes the intersection of two
  sets, returning a vector of their common elements.

  Using these functions, construct and display the vector
  ~commonAnimals~ of animal names common to both data frames.

  How many animals are included in this set? Tip: you can check the
  length of a vector with the function ~length~.

* TODO Identify different data

  The ~setdiff~ function returns a vector of elements contained in one
  set but not in the other: ~setdiff(A,B)~~ returns a vector of
  elements in set ~A~ that are not in set ~B~.

  1) Use ~setdiff~ to display the animals present in ~mammals~ that are *not*
     present in ~Animals2~.

  2) Use ~setdiff~ to display the animals present in ~Animals2~ that are *not*
     present in ~mammals~.

  3) Can you give a simple (qualitative) characterization of these
     differences between the two sets of animals? (Look at the
     output!)
