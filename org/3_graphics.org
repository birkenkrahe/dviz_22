- What's a snail?
- Exploratory vs explanatory graphics
- Plot arrays and their use
- Base graphics plot functions
- R packages: ~grid~, ~lattice~, ~ggplot~
- Which graphics package should you use?

- What is the purpose of "graphics". Give some examples!
- What does "The Snail" by Matisse achieve as graphics?

#+begin_notes
- Graphics: beauty/aesthetics, abstract representation of data
- Technique: color, line, medium, object, artist (subject)
- Origin: something written or drawn (also: basic unit of speech)
- John 8:6-8 "Jesus bent down and started writing on the ground with
  his finger." The Pharisees leave and Jesus is alone with the woman
  whom he saved from being stoned to death for adultery.

* Infographics vs. data visualization

*How would you describe the difference? Got an example?*

* Infographics

- Aesthetically rich (i.e. beautiful/nice to look at)
- Manually drawn (i.e. hard to create/alter/check)
- Represents specific data source

Example: 8-business-model Cow ([[https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/this-cow-illustrates-8-business-models-infographic/292515][Leadem, 2017]])
#+attr_html: :width 200px
[[../img/cow.png]]

* Data visualization

- Aesthetically barren (i.e. not decorated/beautiful)
- Algorithmically drawn (i.e. easy to create/alter/check)
- Rich in data details

Example: interactive network visualization with [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/visNetwork/vignettes/Introduction-to-visNetwork.html][visNetwork in R]]
([[https://www.r-bloggers.com/2019/06/interactive-network-visualization-with-r/][Junker, 2019]])

* Exploratory vs explanatory data visualization

*How would you describe the difference? Got an example?*

* Exploratory data visualization

- Helps us to understand what is in a *data set*
- Alternate name: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Quickly *identify* features, curves, lines, trends, anomalies
- Best done at a high level of *granularity*
- Difficulty: separate *signals* from *noise*

Example: CRAN ggplot2 package downloads 2012-2019

* Explanatory data visualization

- Help us *convey* findings to others
- Alternate name: Data Storytelling
- Known to you at the outset (apart from *feedback*)
- *Design* to accommodate a particular *audience*
- Best done after *editorial decisions* what is relevant
- Difficulty: *selecting* focused data that support your *story*

* Extended example: US cereal data
[[../img/cereal.jpg]]

- Using: ~UScereal~ data frame from the ~MASS~ package
- 11 characteristics of 65 breakfast cereals available for sale
- Information mostly based on the package label required by US FDA
  
#+begin_src R :session :results output
library(MASS)  # load MASS package
data(UScereal) # load UScereal data frame
str(UScereal)  # display data frame structure
#+end_src

* Exploratory plot array

A useful, and common, exploratory plot is a panel of pairwise
scatterplots to summarize the data frame.

#+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output graphics file :file ../img/cereal.png
  plot(UScereal, las = 2)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:../img/cereal.png]]

#+begin_notes
- The ~las~ parameter sets the position of the tick labels - ~las=2~ means
  always perpendicular to the axis.
- Diagonal elements of the array lis the name of the variable in the
  x-axis of all plots in that column, and the y-axis of all plots in
  that row.
- For 11 variables, 110 plots are shown. Some indicate strong
  relationships, e.g. ~fat~ and ~calories~.
- Some variables, like ~vitamins~, show only few values
#+end_notes

* Explanatory scatterplot

#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[../img/scatterplot.png]]

#+begin_notes
- Scatterplot of calories vs. sugar variables, augmented with a robust
  regression line ("[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_regression][robustness]]" refers to assumptions about the data)
- Dashed line highlights the trend our eye sees in the data if we
  ignore the two outlying points.
- The outliers correspond to cereals that have much higher calories
  than any of the others.
- The annotation of labels and text in the plot further aids the
  interpretation.
#+end_notes 

#+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output graphics file :file ../calories.png
plot(data=UScereal, calories ~ sugars)
#+end_src

* TODO Base graphics plot functions
* TODO ~grid~ package
* TODO ~lattice~ package
* TODO ~ggplot~ package
* TODO Which package to use when
* The ~plot~ function


* IN PROGRESS Concept summary

- Infographics are design-rich and built to inform, data
  visualizations (and dashboards) are data-rich and built to be
  flexible and alterable

- Exploratory/explanatory graphics have different challenges. EDA:
  separate signal from noise; storytelling: tell a good story!
