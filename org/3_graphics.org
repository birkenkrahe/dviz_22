#+begin_notes
- Graphics: beauty/aesthetics, abstract representation of data
- Technique: color, line, medium, object, artist (subject)
- Origin: something written or drawn (also: basic unit of speech)
- John 8:6-8 "Jesus bent down and started writing on the ground with
  his finger." The Pharisees leave and Jesus is alone with the woman
  whom he saved from being stoned to death for adultery.

* Infographics vs. data visualization

*How would you describe the difference? Got an example?*

* Infographics

- Aesthetically rich (i.e. beautiful/nice to look at)
- Manually drawn (i.e. hard to create/alter/check)
- Represents specific data source

Example: 8-business-model Cow ([[https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/this-cow-illustrates-8-business-models-infographic/292515][Leadem, 2017]])
#+attr_html: :width 200px
[[../img/cow.png]]

* Data visualization

- Aesthetically barren (i.e. not decorated/beautiful)
- Algorithmically drawn (i.e. easy to create/alter/check)
- Rich in data details

Example: interactive network visualization with [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/visNetwork/vignettes/Introduction-to-visNetwork.html][visNetwork in R]]
([[https://www.r-bloggers.com/2019/06/interactive-network-visualization-with-r/][Junker, 2019]])
#+attr_html: :width 200px
[[../img/visedges.png]]

* Exploratory vs explanatory data visualization

*How would you describe the difference? Got an example?*

* Exploratory data visualization

- Helps us to understand what is in a *data set*
- Alternate name: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Quickly *identify* features, curves, lines, trends, anomalies
- Best done at a high level of *granularity*
- Difficulty: separate *signals* from *noise*

Example: CRAN ggplot2 package downloads 2012-2019
#+attr_html: :width 300px
[[../img/2_ggplot2.png]]

[[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Visualize.CRAN.Downloads/vignettes/Visualize.CRAN.Downloads.html][Image source: Visualize.Cran.Downloads]] (CRAN, 2021)

* Explanatory data visualization

- Help us *convey* findings to others
- Alternate name: Data Storytelling
- Known to you at the outset (apart from *feedback*)
- *Design* to accommodate a particular *audience*
- Best done after *editorial decisions* what is relevant
- Difficulty: *selecting* focused data that support your *story*

* Extended example: US cereal data
[[../img/cereal.jpg]]

- Using: ~UScereal~ data frame from the ~MASS~ package
- 11 characteristics of 65 breakfast cereals available for sale
- Information mostly based on the package label required by US FDA

#+begin_src R :session :results output
  library(MASS)  # load MASS package
  data(UScereal) # load UScereal data frame
  str(UScereal)  # display data frame structure
#+end_src

* Exploratory plot array

A useful, and common, exploratory plot is a panel of pairwise
scatterplots to summarize the data frame.

#+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output graphics file :file ../img/cereal.png
  plot(UScereal, las = 2)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:../img/cereal.png]]

#+begin_notes
- The ~las~ parameter sets the position of the tick labels - ~las=2~ means
  always perpendicular to the axis.
- Diagonal elements of the array lis the name of the variable in the
  x-axis of all plots in that column, and the y-axis of all plots in
  that row.
- For 11 variables, 110 plots are shown. Some indicate strong
  relationships, e.g. ~fat~ and ~calories~.
- Some variables, like ~vitamins~, show only few values
#+end_notes

* Explanatory scatterplot

#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[../img/scatterplot.png]]

#+begin_notes
- Scatterplot of calories vs. sugar variables, augmented with a robust
  regression line ("[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_regression][robustness]]" refers to assumptions about the data)
- Dashed line highlights the trend our eye sees in the data if we
  ignore the two outlying points.
- The outliers correspond to cereals that have much higher calories
  than any of the others.
- The annotation of labels and text in the plot further aids the
  interpretation.
#+end_notes

#+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output graphics file :file ../calories.png
plot(data=UScereal, calories ~ sugars)
#+end_src

* Base graphics plot functions

- Base graphics is the system originally built into the R language
- It's most common generic function is ~plot~
- Base graphics are controlled by 72 graphics /parameters/
- Displays can be customized by /low-level/ plotting functions
- Examples: ~abline~, ~lines~, ~points~, ~text~, ~legend~ etc.

#+name: tab:graphicsfunctions
| FUNCTION      | OBJECT TYPE            | NATURE OF PLOT[fn:1]         |
|---------------+------------------------+------------------------|
| ~plot~          | Many                   | Depends on object type |
| ~barplot~       | Numeric                | Bar plot               |
| ~boxplot~       | Formula, numeric, list | Boxplot summary        |
| ~hist~          | Numeric                | Histogram              |
| ~sunflowerplot~ | Numeric + Numeric      | Sunflower plot         |
| ~mosaicplot~    | Formula or table       | Mosaic plot            |
| ~symbols~       | Multiple numeric       | Bubbleplots etc.       |

* Many many types of built-in diagrams

- There are more than 40 types of useful diagrams in R
  #+caption: Source: R graph gallery
  #+attr_html: :width 500px
  [[../img/rgraph.png]]

* ~grid~ graphics

- The ~grid~ package uses the [[https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/grDevices/versions/3.6.2][grDevices]] graphics engine

- Some packages use it, e.g. [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vcd/index.html][vcd]] (for graphing categorical variables)

- Nothing to do with the ~grid~ function of the base R package (which
  draws a grid over the plot, see ~?grid~)

- More info: [[https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/grid/grid.html#downloaddocs][Paul Murrell's documents]]

#+attr_html: :width 500px  
[[../img/grid.png]]

* ~lattice~ graphics

- Based on grid graphics, shipped with base R (needs to be loaded)

- Alternative implementation to many standard plotting functions,
  including scatterplots, bar charts, boxplots, histograms, QQ-plots

- [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lattice/lattice.pdf][lattice]] has different default options for plot customization and
  some additional features, like the /multipanel conditioning plot/

  #+begin_src R :results graphics file :file ../img/lattice.png
  library(MASS) # load MASS package for Cars93 data set
  library(lattice) # load lattice package

  ## plot MPG.city vs. Horsepower, conditioned by Cylinders
  xyplot(MPG.city ~ Horsepower | Cylinders, data = Cars93)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:../img/lattice.png]]

- You can ~group~ variables and get an automatic legend per group

- Price to be paid: simple annotations are harder to do than base R
  
* Grammar of graphics with ~ggplot2~

- Grammar of graphics construction based on human perception

- Better support for multipanel conditioning plots

- Highly extensible, complex, steep learning curve ([[https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/][see here]])

#+attr_html: :width 500px

* The ~plot~ function

- ~plot(x,y)~ is a /generic/ function - it adapts to its arguments: e.g.

  | Plot type   | ~x~       | ~y~       |
  |-------------+---------+---------|
  | Scatterplot | ~numeric~ | ~numeric~ |
  | Boxplot     | ~factor~  | ~numeric~ |
  | Bar chart   | ~factor~  | ~NA~      |
  | Mosaic plot | ~factor~  | ~factor~  |

- For an overview of the different methods available, use ~methods~.

* TODO Preparations to code along

[[../img/emacsprep.png]]

- Open a new Org-mode file ~plot.org~ in Emacs

- Put this line at the top of the file ~plot.org~:

  ~#+PROPERTY: header-args:R :results output :session *R*~

- Activate the code by putting your cursor on the line and entering
  ~C-c C-c~. You should see the message ~Local setup has been refreshed~
  in the minibuffer at the bottom of the editor.

- When you execute your first R code block, you'll be asked where you
  want the session named ~*R*~ to run: enter the path to ~plot.org~

- For plots, use the header ~:results graphics file :file plot.png~
  
- When you leave Emacs, you'll be warned that the session ~*R*~ is
  active: you can ignore this warning
* Bar chart with ~plot~

When only one categorical variable is given, ~plot~ generates a bar
chart with one bar per factor level.

#+begin_src R :results graphics file :file ../img/3_barchart.png
  x <- factor(c(1,2,2,3,3,3))
  plot(x)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:../img/3_barchart.png]]

* Line plot with ~plot~

When a time series is given like the data set ~Nile~, ~plot~ generates a
line plot.

#+begin_src R :results graphics file :file ../img/3_lineplot.png
  plot(Nile)
  grid()
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:../img/3_lineplot.png]]

* Box plots with ~plot~

- We used it in the extended example to visualize a data frame, a
  numeric vector, a factor, and a pair of numeric variables

- We used the ~boxplot~ function to create a boxplot summary of heating
  gas consumption before and after installation of insulation.

- The same result with ~plot~:
  #+name: whitesideplot1
  #+begin_src R :results graphics file :file ../img/3_whiteside1.png
    plot(whiteside$Insul,whiteside$Gas)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: whitesideplot1
  [[file:../img/3_whiteside1.png]]

- Customization is simple:
  #+name: whitesideplot2
  #+begin_src R :results graphics file :file ../img/3_whiteside2.png
    plot(x=whiteside$Insul, xlab="Insulation",
         y=whiteside$Gas,   ylab="Gas consumption",
                            main="Whiteside data set")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: whitesideplot2
  [[file:../img/3_whiteside2.png]]

* Decision tree models with ~plot~

- Many modeling functions in R return a object that can be plotted

- Example: /decision tree models/ from the ~whiteside~ data frame using
  the ~rpart~ package.

- This model predicts the average value of the dependent variable,
  ~Gas~, from the values of the other variables, ~Insul~ and ~Temp~.

- Build the model: the formula only has two parts. ~.~ stands for "all
  other variables".
  #+name: rpart1
  #+begin_src R 
    library(rpart)
    rpartModel <- rpart(Gas ~ ., data = whiteside)
    class(rpartModel)
    rpartModel
  #+end_src

- Plot the model and add generic text using ~text~ for ~rpart~ models:

  #+begin_src R :results graphics file :file ../img/3_rpart.png
    plot(rpartModel)
    text(rpartModel)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:../img/3_rpart.png]]

- What methods are available for ~rpart~ and ~text~?

  #+begin_src R
    methods(class = "rpart")
    methods(text)
  #+end_src

* Model-based recursive partitioning with ~plot~

- MOB models have tree-based structures like decision tree models

- Each terminal node contains a linear regression model that generates
  predictions from other covariates (independent variables)

- The code to generate the model looks very similar to ~rpart~: the
  formula has three parts - ~Gas~ is predicted, ~Temp~ is the covariate to
  predict, and ~Insul~ is the partitioning variable used to build the
  tree.
  #+name: MOB1
  #+begin_src R 
    library(partykit) # this will load three other required packages
    MOBmodel <- lmtree(Gas ~ Temp | Insul, data = whiteside)
    class(MOBmodel)
  #+end_src

- In the plot, all records are assigned to one of the nodes, and a
  separate linear regression model that predicts ~Gas~ from ~Temp~ is
  built for each node.
  #+name: MOB2
  #+begin_src R :results graphics file :file 3_mob.png
    plot(MOBmodel)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: MOB2
  [[file:3_mob.png]]

- What methods are available for ~lmtree~?

  #+begin_src R
    methods(class = "lmtree")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : [1] plot    predict print   prune  
  : see '?methods' for accessing help and source code

* What does this mean?

- Enormous graphics flexibility even within the base R graphics package

- You can define your own object classes and construct methods for
  generic functions like ~plot~ or ~summary~ that make them generate
  specialized results for our object classes.

- ~methods~ reveals the "S3 Object" character of R, dependent on the
  packages loaded into your R session. 
  
* Optional parameters for base graphics

- There are 72 optional base graphics parameters set by the ~par~ function

- Check out the help for ~par~ right now

- ~par~ can also be called (like ~options~ and other system functions) 

  #+begin_src R
    names(par())
  #+end_src

- Some of these parameters are read-only (i.e. their values are fixed)
 
* NEXT Important parameters for ~plot~ customization

* IN PROGRESS Concept summary

- Infographics are design-rich and built to inform, data
  visualizations (and dashboards) are data-rich and built to be
  flexible and alterable

- Exploratory/explanatory graphics have different challenges. EDA:
  separate signal from noise; storytelling: tell a good story!
