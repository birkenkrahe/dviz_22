This and the next few sections of the course provide a more detailed
description of the objectives of EDA, the reasons for its importance,
and some useful tools and techniques. Based on: Pearson, ch. 3 (2016).

* Key concepts in exploring data

- Velleman and Hoaglin (1991) suggest four R's of EDA:
  1) Revelation
  2) Residuals
  3) Re-expression
  4) Resistance

- *Revelation* refers to data visualization as a way of revealing
  underlying patterns in the data. All the graphs we've created so far
  were examples of this activity.

- *Residuals* refers to the differences between observed values of a
  variable and its predictions from some mathematical model. Models
  used in EDA (like ~mean~ and ~median~) can reveal patterns but such
  simple models would not be sufficient for predictive modeling.

- *Re-expression* refers to the application of mathematical
  transformations to one or more variables. The log transformation is
  an example but there are many more.

- *Resistance* refers to the presence of outliers or other data
  anomalies, which alter the analysis results and need to be
  explained, or removed, or both.

* Exploration strategy

- The most general advice is "take the data seriously" and not just
  the models and tools used to analyse them (Strickland, 2022).

- In the era of Gauss (1777-1855), data were either collected directly
  (/primary data/), or obtained from a trusted friend or colleague
  (/secondary data/). Data sets were small and easy to know.

- Today, datasets are typically much larger, collected by people with
  whom we have no connection, or (like event logs) by machines that we
  did not build ourselves.

- General EDA strategy:
  1) Assess general dataset characteristics
  2) Examine descriptive statistics for each variable
  3) Examine exploratory visualizations
  4) Look for data anomalies
  5) Look at relations between key variables
  6) Summarize the results in form of a /data dictionary/

* Assess general dataset characteristics

This step can often be achieved with built-in R functions like
~summary~, ~head~, or ~str~. 

- How many records do we have?
- How many variables do we have?
- What type is each variable? Numeric, categorical, logical?
- How many unique values does each variable have?
- What value occurs most frequently, and how often does it occur?
- Are there missing observations? If so, how many?
- Do the values look like what we were expecting?
- Do you understand what the variables mean?
- Do you understand how they observations were obtained?

But the intrepid explorer knows how to build his own functions!

* TODO Custom function ~BasicSummary~

- The function generates a preliminary data summary for a data frame ~df~

- Results are returned to precision ~dgts~ (default value ~3~)

  The function returns a data frame with one row for each column of ~df~
  and the following columns:
  1. ~variable~: the name of the corresponding column of ~df~
  2.
