Introduction to some useful tools to get external data not yet loaded
in one of the many R packages, into our R session, as well as saving
results to external data files that can be used by others.

* External data and R

- Data used in an interactive R session is stored in RAM and is
  volatile (disappears at ~quit~)
- External data can be read from or written to with ~read.table~
- Data rendered in HTML on web pages can be extracted

* File management in R

- All functions to read external data assume these files exist in our
  /working directory/

  #+begin_src R
  getwd()  # return working directory
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : [1] "c:/Users/birkenkrahe/Documents/GitHub/dviz/org"

- Notice the use of ~/~ in the ~PATH~ by R (Linux, MacOS) vs. ~\~ by Windows
- Check out where you are with ~M-x shell~ (Windows) and ~M-x eshell~
  (Linux)
  
** Windows ~shell~ and Emacs ~eshell~
