* README

- DSC 302 focuses on data visualization, and especially EDA
  (Exploratory Data Analysis). 
- We use R as a language, GNU Emacs as editor, ESS as statistics
  extension, and Org-mode for literate programming
- For details on objectives, audience, grading, schedule, check the
  [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dviz/blob/piHome/org/syllabus.org][syllabus]] or the [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org][FAQ]] on GitHub.
- This file contains a (dynamically updated) agenda for each session
  as well as some content.
- You can also look at [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dviz/blob/piHome/org/agenda.org][the agenda on GitHub]].

In DSC 302 (Data Visualization), familiarity with the basics of R
would be useful (though, again, we'll learn coding as we go
along). Check the FAQ. The quickest route: complete course
"Introduction to R" in DataCamp. Contact me for free access. Textbook:
Exploratory Data Analysis Using R, chapter 1-8, by R K Pearson (CRC
Press, 2018).
#+end_quote

- General preparation: [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#how-can-i-prepare-for-your-data-science-classes][see the FAQ]] - R, Emacs + ESS + Org-mode
#+begin_notes
Napoleon committed what is called a statistical "Type II" error: he
assumed that the Russians would behave like all his other enemies
had. This was his "null hypothesis", which he should have rejected. If
he had, he might have conquered Russia and would like have created a
different Europe than we know it.
#+end_notes
** Assignments for next week

  have to register with DataCamp and join the Lyon group for fall '22.

- By Wednesday Aug 24, 3 pm: Enter a project idea and team member
  names, and your question(s) [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/571/pages/enter-your-project-idea-and-participants-here][in this table in Canvas]].

** Practice - course infrastructure

*IF YOU ALREADY DID THIS IN ANOTHER CLASS: FINISH THE EMACS TUTORIAL!*

*Useful:* take notes! Practice leads to mastery and the practice
exercises will often come back to haunt you in the tests.

1) Open a browser
2) Find the GitHub repos (birkenkrahe/dviz and /org)
3) Open the command line terminal
4) Open/close R
5) Open Emacs
6) Find the Emacs tutorial
7) Open/close R inside Emacs
8) Run R in an Org-mode file
9) Close Emacs
10) Close the command line terminal

Note: Class room practice completion = 10 points each for active
participation (if there's a practice file, you can make up).

* Week 2: GETTING STARTED

- [X] Getting started with projects
- [X] Quiz 1: course infrastructure
- [ ] Lectures: Data, Exploratory Data Analysis, and R
- [X] Practice: Metadata identification
- [ ] Practice: Representative R session

** Home assignments - how they work
#+attr_html: :width 400px
#+captions: course infrastructure
[[../img/platforms.png]]

- Assignment is posted on [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/571/assignments][Canvas]] (includes the link)
- Assignment must be completed on time on [[https://app.datacamp.com/groups/lyon-college-data-science-fall-2022/assignments][DataCamp]]
- You loose 1 point for every day of late submission
- Canvas Gradebook is updated manually (with some delay)

** Getting started with projects

- Course has 15 participants!

- You'll have to do the project in a team - 2 to 3 people

- I can only accommodate at most 9 projects (last week of term)
- Put your team/ideas into this table ([[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/568/pages/enter-your-project-idea-and-participants-here][Canvas]]) by Wednesday
  
- [X] *Who has not yet found a team?*

- [X] *Who has a team but no idea what to do?* 

- Reminder: plenty of project opportunities ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dviz/blob/piHome/org/1_overview.org#many-project-opportunities][overview]] / GitHub [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dviz/issues][issues]])

- Recommended: overview of visualization in data science (no coding):
  "Preparation, Exploration and Visualization" [[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/data-science-for-everyone][in this DataCamp course]]

#+attr_html: :width 600px
[[../img/datasaurus.png]]

- Featured example: [[https://www.autodesk.com/research/publications/same-stats-different-graphs][Datasaurus Dozen in R (or Python)]] (see also [[https://youtu.be/iwzzv1biHv8][video]])

* Business dashboard example
#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[../img/dashboard.png]]

- The image shows a Power BI dashboard that "uses visualizations to
  tell a story. Because it is limited to one page, a well-designed
  dashboard contains only the most-important elements of that
  story. The visualizations you see on the dashboard are called /tiles/
  and are /pinned/ to the dashboard by report /designers/ [...] Selecting
  a tile takes you to the report page where the visualization was
  created."

#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[../img/dashboard1.png]]
  
- "The visualizations on a dashboard come from reports and each report
  is based on one dataset. In fact, one way to think of a dashboard is
  as an entryway into the underlying reports and datasets. Selecting a
  visualization takes you to the report that was used to create it." 
  
  (Text and image source: Microsoft, 2021)

- DataCamp offers a [[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-power-bi][Power BI course]] - in this course, you'll start
  with Tableau instead (completely comparable product).
  
* Meta data example: nuclear winter
#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[../img/nuclear.jpg]]

- This is strangely similar to simulations that I ran in the 1990s

- [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsmath/issues/27]["Nuclear war between US, Russia would leave 5 billion dead from
  hunger"]] - you can follow this story through three different
  reference frames: 1) USA Today, which is quoting 2) Nature, which is
  quoting 3) the original article. Each time, the meta data changes.

- Mixed this up with [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsmath/issues/26]["Disproving a 60-year-old hypothesis: most
  'silent' mutations are actually harmful"]]
  
* 1st sprint review - Wed 31-Aug

- [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/571/assignments/1689][Canvas assignment with submission]]
- Complete [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/571/pages/enter-your-project-idea-and-participants-here][projects overview table]] in Canvas *today*!
- If you are in > 1 course, you can use the same project idea!

  [[../img/flocking.jpg]]

  - Featured project idea: "[[https://processing.org][Processing]]" for visual artists - see
  e.g. [[https://processing.org/examples/flocking.html]["Flocking"]] to simulate the flocking behavior of birds.

    #+begin_quote
  "Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for
  learning how to code. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software
  literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within
  technology."
