- DSC 302 focuses on data visualization, and especially EDA
  (Exploratory Data Analysis). 
- We use R as a language, GNU Emacs as editor, ESS as statistics
  extension, and Org-mode for literate programming
- For details on objectives, audience, grading, schedule, check the
  [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dviz/blob/piHome/org/syllabus.org][syllabus]] or the [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org][FAQ]] on GitHub.
- This file contains a (dynamically updated) agenda for each session
  as well as some content.
- You can also look at [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dviz/blob/piHome/org/agenda.org][the agenda on GitHub]].

In DSC 302 (Data Visualization), familiarity with the basics of R
would be useful (though, again, we'll learn coding as we go
along). Check the FAQ. The quickest route: complete course
"Introduction to R" in DataCamp. Contact me for free access. Textbook:
Exploratory Data Analysis Using R, chapter 1-8, by R K Pearson (CRC
Press, 2018).

- General preparation: [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#how-can-i-prepare-for-your-data-science-classes][see the FAQ]] - R, Emacs + ESS + Org-mode
#+begin_notes
Napoleon committed what is called a statistical "Type II" error: he
assumed that the Russians would behave like all his other enemies
had. This was his "null hypothesis", which he should have rejected. If
he had, he might have conquered Russia and would like have created a
different Europe than we know it.

* Practice - course infrastructure

*Useful:* take notes! Practice leads to mastery and the practice
exercises will often come back to haunt you in the tests.

1) Open a browser
2) Find the GitHub repos (birkenkrahe/dviz and /org)
3) Open the command line terminal
4) Open/close R
5) Open Emacs
6) Find the Emacs tutorial
7) Open/close R inside Emacs
8) Run R in an Org-mode file
9) Close Emacs
10) Close the command line terminal

*Note:* Class room practice completion = 10 points each for active
participation.
