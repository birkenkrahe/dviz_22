- DSC 302 focuses on data visualization, and especially EDA
  (Exploratory Data Analysis).
- We use R as a language, GNU Emacs as editor, ESS as statistics
  extension, and Org-mode for literate programming
- For details on objectives, audience, grading, schedule, check the
  [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dviz/blob/piHome/org/syllabus.org][syllabus]] or the [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org][FAQ]] on GitHub.
- This file contains a (dynamically updated) agenda for each session
  as well as some content.

In DSC 302 (Data Visualization), familiarity with the basics of R
would be useful (though, again, we'll learn coding as we go
along). Check the FAQ. The quickest route: complete course
"Introduction to R" in DataCamp. Contact me for free access. Textbook:
Exploratory Data Analysis Using R, chapter 1-8, by R K Pearson (CRC
Press, 2018).

- General preparation: [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#how-can-i-prepare-for-your-data-science-classes][see the FAQ]] - R, Emacs + ESS + Org-mode
#+begin_notes
Napoleon committed what is called a statistical "Type II" error: he
assumed that the Russians would behave like all his other enemies
had. This was his "null hypothesis", which he should have rejected. If
he had, he might have conquered Russia and would like have created a
different Europe than we know it.

#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[../img/graphics.png]]

- [X] Getting started with projects
- [X] Quiz 1: course infrastructure
- [ ] Lectures: Data, Exploratory Data Analysis, and R
- [X] Practice: Metadata identification
- [ ] Practice: Representative R session

** DONE Home assignments - how they work
#+attr_html: :width 400px
#+captions: course infrastructure
[[../img/platforms.png]]

- Assignment is posted on [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/571/assignments][Canvas]] (includes the link)
- Assignment must be completed on time on [[https://app.datacamp.com/groups/lyon-college-data-science-fall-2022/assignments][DataCamp]]
- You loose 1 point for every day of late submission
- Canvas Gradebook is updated manually (with some delay)

** DONE Getting started with projects

- Course has 15 participants!

- You'll have to do the project in a team - 2 to 3 people

- I can only accommodate at most 9 projects (last week of term)
- Put your team/ideas into this table ([[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/568/pages/enter-your-project-idea-and-participants-here][Canvas]]) by Wednesday

- [X] *Who has not yet found a team?*

- [X] *Who has a team but no idea what to do?*

- Reminder: plenty of project opportunities ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dviz/blob/piHome/org/1_overview.org#many-project-opportunities][overview]] / GitHub [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dviz/issues][issues]])

- Recommended: overview of visualization in data science (no coding):
  "Preparation, Exploration and Visualization" [[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/data-science-for-everyone][in this DataCamp course]]
** DONE Project idea: datasaurus dozen
#+attr_html: :width 600px
[[../img/datasaurus.png]]

- Featured example: [[https://www.autodesk.com/research/publications/same-stats-different-graphs][Datasaurus Dozen in R (or Python)]] (see also [[https://youtu.be/iwzzv1biHv8][video]])

** DONE Business dashboard example
#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[../img/dashboard.png]]

- The image shows a Power BI dashboard that "uses visualizations to
  tell a story. Because it is limited to one page, a well-designed
  dashboard contains only the most-important elements of that
  story. The visualizations you see on the dashboard are called /tiles/
  and are /pinned/ to the dashboard by report /designers/ [...] Selecting
  a tile takes you to the report page where the visualization was
  created."

#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[../img/dashboard1.png]]

- "The visualizations on a dashboard come from reports and each report
  is based on one dataset. In fact, one way to think of a dashboard is
  as an entryway into the underlying reports and datasets. Selecting a
  visualization takes you to the report that was used to create it."

  (Text and image source: Microsoft, 2021)

- DataCamp offers a [[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-power-bi][Power BI course]] - in this course, you'll start
  with Tableau instead (completely comparable product).

** DONE Meta data example: nuclear winter
#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[../img/nuclear.jpg]]

- This is strangely similar to simulations that I ran in the 1990s

- [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsmath/issues/27]["Nuclear war between US, Russia would leave 5 billion dead from
  hunger"]] - you can follow this story through three different
  reference frames: 1) USA Today, which is quoting 2) Nature, which is
  quoting 3) the original article. Each time, the meta data changes.

- I mixed this up with [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsmath/issues/26]["Disproving a 60-year-old hypothesis: most
  'silent' mutations are actually harmful"]]

** DONE 1st sprint review - Wed 31-Aug

- [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/571/assignments/1689][Canvas assignment with submission]]
- Complete [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/571/pages/enter-your-project-idea-and-participants-here][projects overview table]] in Canvas *today*!
- If you are in > 1 course, you can use the same project idea!

  [[../img/flocking.jpg]]

  - Featured project idea: "[[https://processing.org][Processing]]" for visual artists - see
  e.g. [[https://processing.org/examples/flocking.html]["Flocking"]] to simulate the flocking behavior of birds.

  #+begin_quote
  "Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for
  learning how to code. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software
  literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within
  technology."
  #+end_quote

** DONE Review: What's the problem with meta data?

[[../img/review.jpg]]

#+begin_quote
- *Completeness* - origin
- *Consistency* - logic, values, (time) dependency
- *Accuracy* - origin and validity
#+end_quote

** DONE Project idea: "Count" dashboard ([[https://count.co/][count.co]])

** DONE Test 2 open ("Data, EDA, and R")

** DONE Practice: Run R in Org-mode file

- [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dviz/blob/piHome/org/1_overview_practice.org#run-r-in-org-mode-file][Instructions in GitHub]]
- Update your Emacs configuration file
- Check that you can run R inside Emacs

** TODO Practice: a representative R session

** DONE DataCamp: visualizing distributions

- What did you think of this lesson?
- Review question: when do you use histograms?
- Review question: when do you use boxplots?

#+begin_notes
- Histogram: you have a single numeric-continuous variable, and you
  want to ask questions about the shape of its distribution/frequency.
- Example: ~Nile~ dataset

  #+begin_src R :file ../img/nile.png :exports both :session :results output graphics file
    hist(Nile)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:../img/nile.png]]

- Boxplot: single numeric-continuous variable split by a categorical
  variable, and you want to compare distributions for each category.
- Example: ~ToothGrowth~

  #+begin_src R :file ../img/tg.png :exports both :session :results output graphics file
    boxplot(ToothGrowth$len ~ ToothGrowth$supp)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:../img/tg.png]]

#+end_notes

** PROJECT Project idea: [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dviz/issues/29][healthcare data visualization]]
** READ GNU Emacs: ref cards
#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[../img/gnu.jpg]]

- [ ] The power of Dired on one page ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/emacs/dired-ref.pdfhttps://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/dired-ref.pdf][v28]])
- [ ] The power of Emacs on two pages ([[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf][v27]])

** Practice: extended R EDA example

- histogram with ~hist~ and ~boxplot~
- ~head~ and ~tail~
- structure of a data set with ~str~
- ~factor~ vectors have distinct values (~levels~)

** Review [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/571/assignments/1715][test 2 - data, EDA, and R]]

- *Dataset help:* What does ~MASS::Boston~ mean?

- *Article meta data* that need to be reviewed critically to analyze an
  article, include 1) reference, 2) acknowledgements with contributing
  experts (this is unusual).

- *Products are not data*. Data: (information) entity, event, process.

- Why do *non-numerical* data have to be converted to numbers?

* Week 4: Visualizing two variables

A bunch of webinars on different aspects of data literacy, "the
ability to read, write, communicate, and reason with data. Data
literacy skills are foundational for succeeding in the 21st century,
and are the prerequisites for a career in data." ([[https://www.datacamp.com/data-literacy-month][DataCamp]])

** DONE Review: 1st sprint review
#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[../img/lost.jpg]]

- Some of you did not enter information in the overview sheet and/or
  did not submit a sprint review

- You can and should still submit (2 pts penalty per day of late
  submission)

- If you double up with another course, your sprint reviews need to
  reflect different research questions, or methods, or results

- Important: references and sources.

- Next sprint review: 30th September

** DONE Review: Visualizing two variables
*** Example: Nile
- Plot example: use ~Nile~ data set
  #+begin_src R :results output
                                            # ?Nile ## what's in the data set?
    str(Nile)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  :  Time-Series [1:100] from 1871 to 1970: 1120 1160 963 1210 1160 1160 813 1230 1370 1140 ...

  #+begin_src R :file ../img/line.png :results output graphics file
    plot(Nile)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:../img/line.png]]

*** Line plots
- Swiss "Jugendstrafrechtspflege" (juvenile offender stats, [[https://www.zh.ch/de/sicherheit-justiz/jugendstrafrecht/zahlen-fakten.html#446794079][source]]).
  Contrast the two plots: what's different?
  #+attr_html: :width 400px
  [[../img/offenders1.png]]
  #+attr_html: :width 400px
  [[../img/offenders2.png]]
*** Boxes vs bars
- Box plots vs. bar plots: what's the difference?
  #+attr_html: :width 600px
  [[../img/boxbar.png]]

  #+begin_notes
  - Box plots answer questions about value spread using measures of
    spread, here: age spread (categorical variable splits data)
  - Bar plots answer questions about the frequency of a single
    continuous metric relative to zero, here: count.
  - In bar plots, other single continuous variables can also be
    plotted, but the results are less insightful than the box plot
  #+end_notes
*** Bars vs stacks

- When would you rather show /stacked bar plots/ than bar plots?

  #+begin_notes
  When you care about percentages. Each stack adds up to 100%
  #+end_notes
*** Bars vs dots

- When should you use a dot plot?
  #+attr_html: :width 600px
  [[../img/dotplots.png]]

  #+begin_notes
  - You have a categorical variable
  - Display numeric scores by category logarithmically - since bars
    must always begin at 0, the log of 0 is infinite, so there is no
    log scale for bar plots
  - Display multiple numeric scores for each category
  #+end_notes

- [X] DataCamp review - The color and the shape
- [X] Exploratory vs. explanatory graphics & R graphics systems
- [X] Complete 1st DataCamp course this week (add to your resume)
- [X] Test 4 review - color, plots, and comparison of data frames

** DataCamp review - The color and the shape

1) What is GNI? Difference between GNI, GNP and GDP?
2) Does it make sense to plot GNI vs. life expectancy vs. schooling?
3) What are plot dimensions besides spatial coordinates?
4) What is the "Viridis" color palette? /[potential project topic]/
5) What are correlation heatmaps useful for?

#+begin_notes
1) What is GNI? Difference between GNI, GNP and GDP? - According to
   [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_national_income][Wikipedia]], GNI (same as GNP) and GDP can differ greatly for
   developing nations, because of foreign aid and capital inflow.
   #+attr_html: :width 400px
   [[../img/gni.png]]

2) Does it make sense to plot GNI vs. life expectancy vs. schooling?
   Remember that correlation is not causation. Correlating
   characteristics however does suggest causation. In this case:
   higher life expectancy seems to be the consequence of long
   schooling and a high GNI. However, does this have to be true?
   Which factors that could invalidate this conclusion? What are
   the weaknesses of the chosen characteristics?[fn:1]

3) What are plot dimensions besides spatial coordinates?
   - color (best option)
   - size (issues with distinguishability, importance)
   - levels of transparency (issues with distinguishability)
   - shape (issues with distinguishing shapes)
   - panels (good for trends)

4) What is the Viridis color palette? - "~viridis~, and its companion
   package ~viridisLite~ provide a series of color maps that are
   designed to improve graph readability for readers with common forms
   of color blindness and/or color vision deficiency. The color maps
   are also perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and also when
   converted to black-and-white for printing.".  Source: [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html][CRAN vignette
   (2021)]]. Fact: ca. 4.5% or 350 million people in the world are
   colorblind ([[https://www.colorblindguide.com/post/colorblind-people-population-live-counter][Source]], 2021).

5) What are correlation heatmaps useful for?  Correlation heatmaps are
   designed to show relationships between pairs of continuous
   variables. They're compact so you can easily compare many variables
   at once. Higher correlation corresponds to brighter colors.[fn:2]

3) Why is "changing line type" not a scatterplot customization?

4) What does a box plot visualize (best, and not what can it work with)?

   #+begin_src R :session :results graphics file :file ../img/box_mtcars.png
     boxplot(mtcars) # boxplot is generic and will digest data frames but
                                             # it won't be interesting or revealing in any way
   #+end_src

   #+begin_src R :session :results graphics file :file ../img/box_tg.png
     boxplot(ToothGrowth) # depends on the data frame though: ToothGrowth
                                             # has got only one numeric variable
   #+end_src

   #+begin_src R :session :results graphics file :file ../img/box_tg1.png
     boxplot(ToothGrowth$len ~ ToothGrowth$supp) # this works!
   #+end_src

5) What's the problem with 3-dimensional plots (of any kind)?

6) What's HCL?
   #+begin_notes
   HCL = Hue-Chroma-Luminence, colorspaces:
   - hue: color of the rainbow
   - chroma: color intensity
   - luminence: color brightness
     [[../img/color.png]]
   #+end_notes

7) What do ~intersect(x,y)~ and ~setdiff(x,y)~ do for vectors ~x~, ~y~?
   #+begin_src R
     x <- c(1,2,3,4,6)
     y <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
     intersect(x,y)
     intersect(y,x) # this function is symmetric

  #+begin_quote
  "The tree illustrates the ancient linguistic links between the
  world’s languages. Trees and branches are often used by linguists
  as a visual metaphor to explain language origination. This tree
  model explains the connections between groups of languages, which
  all descend from a common ancestral proto-language."

- THE COMPUTER SCIENTIST WHO CAN'T STOP TELLING STORIES
  #+attr_html: :width 400px
  [[../img/knuth.jpg]]
  #+begin_quote
  "Knuth’s interest in storytelling also led him to develop a
  philosophy of *literate programming* — a method for writing computer
  programs as literary essays. A literate program intersperses source
  code with elegant prose written in a familiar language, such as
  English. The source code delivers functionality and efficiency,
  while the exposition addresses a human reader, rather than the
  computer’s compiler. Anyone who later updates or debugs a literate
  program will avoid the often time-consuming and costly problem of
  trying to understand the original programmer’s algorithms, design
  decisions and implementation strategies. Knuth is a computer
  scientist who understands that words matter."

* DONE Base graphics parameters
#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[../img/par.png]]

*Review questions:*

1) Which function controls graphic parameters in base R?
2) How can you create a panel of two plots on top of one another?

   #+begin_example R
     par(mfrow=c(2,1))
   #+end_example

3) How can you turn a scatterplot into a line plot?

   #+begin_example R
     plot(x,y, type="l") # x and y are coordinate vectors
   #+end_example

[fn:2]The heatmap correlates different marketing variables from a
customer survey, indicating which characteristics are correlated to
one another. From the map, "holding price increase to a minimum" is
strongly (> 0.7) correlated with "setting competitive prices" - this
means that customers who appreciated stable prices also appreciated if
these prices were competitive (i.e. low by comparison). A correlation
of 1 means perfect correlation - you only need one variable! This is
another use for such heatmaps: eliminate superfluous variables.

[fn:1]GNI: composite characteristic, vulnerable to reporting and
complexity issues, also time-dependent; average lifespan: averages are
skewed by outliers - e.g. death of young children, time-dependent
(natural disasters, war, epidemic etc.), policy-dependent (death
wardens for female babies, 1-child policy); schooling: levels are not
necessarily comparable - e.g. Berlin vs. Bavaria), also what exactly
is studied and learnt varies widely; what about home-schooling? The
parallel coordinates plot in the same lesson shows the variance of
different values across continents, and you see e.g. how widely all
values except GNI vary (this would suggest that it's not a very robust
variable).
