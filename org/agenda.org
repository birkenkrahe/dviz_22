Practice: course infrastructure (see GitHub) - no submission. To be
completed in the classroom. If you actively participated in the
practice session and/or uploaded the completed practice file
(usually Org-mode, occasionally other file formats), you get full
points. If you missed a classroom session with a submittable
practice file, you can complete and submit it later.
